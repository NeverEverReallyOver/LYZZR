The user encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agentscope.manager'`.
I have verified that `agentscope.manager` does NOT exist in the installed version of AgentScope (v1.0.15).
My previous attempt to use `from agentscope.manager import ModelManager` was based on outdated or incorrect assumptions about the API.

I need to find the correct way to load a model in this version of AgentScope.
Based on the file structure:
*   `agentscope.model` exists and exports `ChatModelBase`, `OpenAIChatModel`, etc.
*   There is no central `ModelManager` visible in the top-level directory or `manager` submodule.

However, `agentscope.init()` takes `model_configs`.
Usually, when we pass `model_config_name` to an agent, the framework needs a way to resolve it.

If I cannot find a global model manager, I should manually instantiate the model class.
Since I am using `init_agentscope` to register configurations, there *must* be a registry.
Let's look at `agentscope.model` again. Maybe there is a `load_model_by_config_name` function there?
Or maybe it's in `agentscope._run_config`?

Actually, let's look at `agentscope/model/__init__.py`. It exports model classes.
I suspect `agentscope.init` initializes these models and stores them somewhere.

Wait, if I look at `agentscope.init` implementation in `agentscope/__init__.py`, it calls `setup_logger`.
It *doesn't* seem to process `model_configs` directly in the `init` function I read earlier (lines 72-104 of `agentscope/__init__.py`).
**Wait!** The `init` function I read earlier (lines 72-104) *does not* have a `model_configs` parameter!
But in my `src/agentscope_adapter.py`, I am calling `agentscope.init(model_configs=[...])`.
This suggests my usage of `agentscope.init` might *also* be incorrect for this version, OR the file I read was truncated or I missed it.
Let me re-read `agentscope/__init__.py` carefully.
Ah, I see `init` definition. It takes `project`, `name`, `run_id`... but NO `model_configs`.

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The `agentscope.init` in this installed version does NOT accept `model_configs`.
This means I have been using an API that doesn't exist in this version.

I need to find out how to initialize models in this version.
It is likely that I need to instantiate `OpenAIChatModel` directly and pass the config to it.
Or maybe there is a `agentscope.model.load_model_configs` function?

Let's check `agentscope/model` content again or search for "config" in the codebase.
Actually, I should check `agentscope/manager.py` does not exist.
Maybe `agentscope.models`? (plural) No, it's `model`.

Let's try to search for where `model_configs` are handled.
If `agentscope.init` doesn't handle it, maybe I should just create the model instance directly in my `DatingAgent`.

Plan:
1.  Modify `src/agentscope_adapter.py` to:
    *   Remove `model_configs` from `agentscope.init()` call.
    *   Directly instantiate `OpenAIChatModel` (or `PostAPIModel` if using Kimi via generic API) inside `DatingAgent`.
    *   Since I am using Kimi (Moonshot), I should use `OpenAIChatModel` as Kimi is OpenAI-compatible.

I need to check `OpenAIChatModel` signature in `agentscope/model/_openai_model.py`.

Refined Plan:
1.  Read `agentscope/model/_openai_model.py` to understand how to instantiate it.
2.  Update `src/agentscope_adapter.py` to:
    *   Import `OpenAIChatModel`.
    *   In `DatingAgent.__init__`, instantiate `self.model = OpenAIChatModel(...)` using the API key and config.
    *   Remove `model_configs` from `init_agentscope`.

This bypasses the missing "Manager" and "Config Registration" system which seems absent or different in this version.

Wait, if I look at `agentscope/manager.py` error, it says `No module named 'agentscope.manager'`.
But I also see `agentscope/__init__.py` has `from . import model`.

Let's verify `OpenAIChatModel` first.
