I will help you upload your code to GitHub.

Since this is the first time you are committing code in this environment, I need to configure your Git identity locally. I will use your GitHub username (`NeverEverReallyOver`) and the standard GitHub no-reply email format to keep your privacy protected.

Here are the steps I will execute:
1.  **Configure Git**: Set local username to `NeverEverReallyOver` and email to `NeverEverReallyOver@users.noreply.github.com`.
2.  **Commit Code**: Save all your current files (including the new `.gitignore` and `README.md`) to the local Git repository.
3.  **Link Repository**: Connect your local folder to the remote GitHub repository `https://github.com/NeverEverReallyOver/LYZZR.git`.
4.  **Upload (Push)**: I will trigger the upload command.
    *   *Note*: A GitHub login window may pop up on your screen, or you may need to enter your credentials in the terminal.

After I execute these commands, your code will be live on GitHub!
