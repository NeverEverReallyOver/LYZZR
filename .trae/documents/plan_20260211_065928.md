The user is encountering an `AttributeError: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'content'`.
This is happening in `src/agentscope_adapter.py` at `for block in response.content:`.

The error implies that `response` is an `async_generator`, not a `ChatResponse` object.
This means `self.model(messages=messages)` returned an async generator.

Looking at `OpenAIChatModel.__call__` signature (which I read earlier):

```python
    async def __call__(
        self,
        # ...
    ) -> ChatResponse | AsyncGenerator[ChatResponse, None]:
```

It returns an async generator if `stream=True` (which defaults to True in `__init__`).

In `DatingAgent.__init__`, I initialized `OpenAIChatModel` without specifying `stream`.

```python
        self.model = OpenAIChatModel(
            model_name="moonshot-v1-8k",
            api_key=api_key,
            # ...
        )
```

The default for `stream` is `True` in `OpenAIChatModel`.

So `self.model(...)` is returning a stream.
I have two options:

1. **Disable Streaming**: Set `stream=False` in `OpenAIChatModel` initialization. This is the simplest fix.
2. **Handle Streaming**: Iterate over the async generator `response` to collect the full content.

Since the `reply` method logic currently expects a single `response` object with `.content`, disabling streaming is the most straightforward path to get it working quickly.

Plan:

1. Modify `src/agentscope_adapter.py`:

   * In `DatingAgent.__init__`, pass `stream=False` to `OpenAIChatModel` constructor.

   * This will force the model to return a single `ChatResponse` object instead of an async generator.

This should resolve the `AttributeError`.

**Note**: If I wanted to keep streaming (for better UI experience), I would need to rewrite `reply` to consume the generator:

```python
        full_response_content = []
        async for chunk in response:
            full_response_content.extend(chunk.content)
            # handle partial updates if needed
        # construct final response
```

But for now, `stream=False` is safer and quicker to fix the crash.

Plan:

1. Update `src/agentscope_adapter.py` to set `stream=False`.
