I have identified the issue. The `AgentBase` class in AgentScope (as seen in `_agent_base.py`) has an `__init__` method that takes **no arguments** (`def __init__(self) -> None:`), but I am passing `name`, `sys_prompt`, and `model_config_name` to `super().__init__(...)`.

This confirms that `AgentBase` is a very low-level base class. I need to handle the `name`, `sys_prompt`, and `model_config_name` assignment myself in my `DatingAgent` class, or use a higher-level agent class if available (but `DialogAgent` was missing).

Since I am already inheriting from `AgentBase`, I should:

1. Call `super().__init__()` without arguments.
2. Manually assign `self.name`, `self.sys_prompt`, and initialize the model.
3. Wait, `AgentBase` inherits from `StateModule`. I need to check how to initialize the model.
4. Looking at `agentscope` documentation or examples (which I don't have direct access to, but I can infer), usually there's a mixin or I should just instantiate the model wrapper myself.

However, `AgentBase` does have `self.id = shortuuid.uuid()`.
I see `from ..module import StateModule`.

Let's look at `DatingAgent` again.
I need to:

1. Call `super().__init__()`.
2. Set `self.name = profile.name`.
3. Set `self.sys_prompt = ...`.
4. Initialize the model. In AgentScope, `self.model` is usually an instance of a model wrapper.
   I can use `agentscope.manager.ModelManager.get_instance().get_model_by_config_name(model_config_name)`?
   Or maybe `agentscope.models.load_model_by_config_name(model_config_name)`?

Let's try to find how to load a model.
I'll check `agentscope/__init__.py` to see what's exposed.

Actually, a simpler way is to check `agentscope/agent/user_agent.py` or similar to see how they implement it.
But for now, I will modify `src/agentscope_adapter.py` to:

1. Fix the `super().__init__()` call.
2. Manually set attributes.
3. Use `agentscope.manager.ModelManager.get_instance().get_model_by_config_name(model_config_name)` to get the model.

Plan:

1. Check `agentscope/manager.py` or similar to find how to get a model instance.
2. Update `src/agentscope_adapter.py`.
